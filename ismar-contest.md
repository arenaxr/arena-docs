# Hybrid Conference Experiences in the ARENA
{: .fs-9 }

ISMAR 2021 Contest Entry
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Introduction

We are using the [Augmented Reality Edge Network Architecture (ARENA)](https://arenaxr.org) to support a hybrid conference experience. ARENA is a platform based on web technologies that simplifies the creation of collaborative mixed reality for standard Web Browsers. See more details about the ARENA by browsing the menu items on the left.

**The link to our "conference venue" is at the end of this page. Before following it, be sure to check these instructions and requirements.**

## Hybrid Conference Experience

We prepared our lab to host the "conference venue." Some example images of the VR view of the lab below.

We will have several in-person participants, as described in the table. In-person participants will interact with remote participants through their devices. **Say hi, or ask us a question!**

|Display Name|Device|Description|
|------------|------|-----------|
|AR1|iPad|Present in the scene as a robot head, streaming the screen to one of the VR displays on the wall.|
|AR3|iPad|Present in the scene as a robot head.|
|AR3|Android Phone| Present in the scene as a video cube texture-mapped with the user facing camera.|
|Speaker|Magic Leap| Speaker will be using a Magic Leap (present in the scene as a video cube texture mapped with the video from the camera facing the speaker) and presenting slides visible to in-person and remote participants (laptop screen-sharing).|

We also have an AR/VR portal where remote participants can interact with in-person participants and see a glimpse into what is happening at the physical location. The portal is registered in the 3D scan, so the virtual and real-world geometry are aligned.

Our platform (ARENA) can scale up to many users in the same scene, not fitting into the physical space. Thus, we expand the space with a virtual area that remote users can explore and see other content, such as demo posters.

## Instructions for Remote Participants

### Requirements
For the best ARENA performance, you need a couple of things:
- **Browser** (we have tested ARENA with recent Chrome and FireFox)
- No ad blockers/privacy extensions (sorry, we are working on it; some are known to cause issues)
- **Headphones highly recommended**. They provide directional sound and stop echo. Please stay on mute when not speaking if you donâ€™t have headphones.
- A fast, recent machine to handle all the processing and 3D graphics is also **highly recommended**

Details about the VR user interface in our ["First time in the ARENA"](/content/overview/user-guide.html) tutorial.

### Enter the VR Environment

Remote participants can use VR in a browser or a VR headset to navigate the lab space and meet both remote and in-person attendees. Everyone is referenced in the real venue, so remote participants should have a sense of interacting with in-person participants in a shared space.

**The experience is available in most browsers by following this link:**
- **Public: [https://arenaxr.org/wiselab/ismar](https://arenaxr.org/wiselab/ismar)**
- **Judges:** A private link will be emailed to judges.
