# Hybrid Conference Experiences in the ARENA
{: .fs-9 }

ISMAR 2021 Contest Entry
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Introduction

We present an alternative hybrid conference experience where remote attendees can interact (in VR) with attendees wearing AR headsets and tablets. By using a 3D model of the venue (obtained using an off-the-shelf laser scanner) and registering digital objects with the real world, remote attendees have a similar sense of the space as those physically present.

We are using the [Augmented Reality Edge Network Architecture (ARENA)](https://arenaxr.org) to support this hybrid conference experience. ARENA is a platform that simplifies the creation of collaborative mixed reality for standard Web Browsers. See more details about the ARENA by browsing the menu items on the left.

**The link to our "conference venue" is at the end of this page. Before following it, be sure to check these instructions and requirements.**

## Hybrid Conference Experience

We prepared our lab to host the "conference venue." The figure below shows our VR setup.

Several in-person participants (named AR1, AR2, AR3, ...) will be using a mix of AR devices (iPads, phones, magic leap) and interact with remote participants through their devices. **Say hi, or ask us a question!**

We also have an AR/VR portal where remote participants can interact with in-person participants and see a glimpse into what is happening at the physical location. The portal is registered in the 3D scan, so the virtual and real-world geometry are aligned.

Our platform (ARENA) can scale up to many users in the same scene, not fitting into the physical space. Thus, we expand the space with a virtual area that remote users can explore and see other content.

## Instructions for Remote Participants

### Requirements
For the best ARENA performance, you need a couple of things:
- **Browser** (we have tested ARENA with recent Chrome and FireFox)
- No ad blockers/privacy extensions (sorry, we are working on it; some are known to cause issues)
- **Headphones highly recommended**. They provide directional sound and stop echo. Please stay on mute when not speaking if you donâ€™t have headphones.
- A fast, recent machine to handle all the processing and 3D graphics is also **highly recommended**

Details about the VR user interface in our ["First time in the ARENA"](/content/overview/user-guide.html) tutorial.

### Enter the VR Environment

Remote participants can use VR in a browser or a VR headset to navigate the lab space and meet both remote and in-person attendees. Everyone is referenced in the real venue, so remote participants should have a sense of interacting with in-person participants in a shared space.

**The experience is available in most browsers by following this link:**
- **Public: [https://arenaxr.org/wiselab/ismar](https://arenaxr.org/wiselab/ismar)**
- **Judges:** A private link will be emailed to judges.
