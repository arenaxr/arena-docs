# Hybrid Conference Experiences in the ARENA
{: .fs-9 }

ISMAR 2021 Contest Entry
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Introduction

We propose using the [Augmented Reality Edge Network Architecture (ARENA)](https://arenaxr.org) to support a hybrid conference experience. ARENA is a platform based on web technologies that simplifies the creation of collaborative mixed reality for standard Web Browsers. See more details about the ARENA by browsing the menu items on the left.

## Hybrid Conference Experience

We plan to prepare our lab to host the "conference venue." Some example images of the VR view of the lab below.

We will have several (2+) in-person participants with mobile AR through WebXR browsers. A speaker will also be present using an AR headset and presenting slides visible to in-person and remote participants. In-person participants will interact with remote participants through their tablets and headsets. We will stream the video of an AR device and of the actual space into surfaces in the VR environment such that these points of view are visible to remote participants.

Our platform (ARENA) can scale up to many users in the same scene, not fitting into the physical space. Thus, we expand the space with a virtual area that remote users can explore and see other content, such as demo posters.

## Instructions for Remote Participants

### Requirements
For the best ARENA performance, you need a couple of things:
- **Chrome or Edge Web Browser** (FireFox also works, but sometimes FireFox doesn’t send video)
- No ad blockers (some blockers are okay, others cause issues)
- **Headphones highly recommended**. They provide directional sound and stop echo. Please stay on mute when not speaking if you don’t have headphones.
- A fast, recent machine to handle all the processing and 3D graphics is also *highly recommended*

Details about the VR user interface in our ["First time in the ARENA"](/content/overview/user-guide.html) tutorial.

### Enter the VR Environment

Remote participants can use VR in a browser or a VR headset to navigate the lab space and meet both remote and in-person attendees. Everyone is referenced in the real-world, so remote participants should have a sense of interacting with in-person participants in a shared space.

**The experience is available in most browsers (although we recommend Chrome at this time), by following this link:
