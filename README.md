# ARENA Documentation Website

This is the ARENA Documentation website giving architecture, APIs, and step-by-step instructions to use the ARENA project. This is a static site generated by Jekyll, and is deployed on push to [https://arena.conix.io](https://arena.conix.io).

- TODO: Write the docs.
- TODO: Configure html-proofer correctly.

## Local Development
* [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation)
* Install any new ruby packages: `make install`
* Dependencies: `make update`
* Build and test: `make serve`
* Preview site at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

## Content

ARENA Documentation pages are written in markdown and placed in the `content` directory, except for `./index.md`.

Each `.md` file inside `content` must have [YAML Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter) for navigation. The navigation details are determined by our theme. See the ARENA-modified [just-the-docs](https://github.com/conix-center/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure) theme for more details about site navigation.

## Test

```shell
make serve
```

This will create a watcher that will update and regenerate the localhost test site and allow you to immediately preview changes formatted to HTML.

The newly generated website will be placed in the `_site` directory.

## Check HTML and Links

Look for broken links and correct HTML using [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer):

```shell
make check
```

## Comments
If you really need to comment out your text, it's not supported, but you can hack it this way:
```markdown
[//]: # (comment)
```

## Alerts/Callouts
Callout alerts are available. Use this syntax:
```markdown
{% include alert type="warning" title="Coming Soon" content="Stay tuned for more details..." %}
```
- heading
- info
- tip
- warning
- danger
