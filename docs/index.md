## Background

Many have predicted the future of the Web to be the integration of Web content with the real-world through technologies such as augmented reality. This overlay of virtual content on top of the physical world, called the Spatial Web (in different contexts might be called AR Cloud, MetaVerse, Digital Twin), holds promise for dramatically changing the Internet as we see it today, and has broad application. However, building pervasive mixed (virtual and augmented) reality applications is challenging for several reasons: 

1. applications require global instant-on localization; 
2. ideally, multiple users should interact with the content; 
3. tight latency requirements; 
4. diversity of compute and interaction capabilities.

The Augmented Reality Edge Networking Architecture (ARENA) addresses many of the challenges of building collaborative mixed reality applications. It is designed to allow interactions with and within the physical world, with locality and pervasive sensing as first-class citizens.

## Overview

The ARENA is a network transparent multi-user environment that simplifies the development of mixed reality applications. It allows cross-platform interaction with 3D content that can be generated by any number of network-connected agents (human or machine) in real-time. The system is built on emerging web standards like WebXR with safe and secure runtime support provided by WebAssembly. The ARENA acts like a distributed operating system for environments where you have a tight coupling between physical and virtual assets. It is network transparent in that users and data can execute and migrate seamlessly across any number of connected computing resources that could include edge servers, in-network processing units, or end-user devices like headsets and mobile phones.

The ARENA currently includes a set of demonstrator agents to handle concurrent physics, easy-to-use localization, 3D skeleton capture, and interfaces with a number of commercially available IoT devices. We recently added support for audio and video streaming from laptop cameras and microphones.
