# VR, AR, XR

ARENA has seamless support for a spectrum of experiences, from completely immersing the user in a digital world (Virtual Reality; VR) to enhancing the real world with interactive digital content (Augmented Reality; AR). A spectrum currently identified as **miXed Reality (XR)**.

The following video demonstrates an ARENA use case for hybrid conference experiences. We use a 3D scan of the conference venue as the backdrop environment for remote users and a model to stage various AR interactions for in-person users. Remote participants can use VR in a browser or a VR headset to navigate the scene. In-person participants can use AR headsets or mobile AR through WebXR browsers to see and hear remote users.

ARENA leverages modern [WebXR-capable browsers](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) to support diverse platforms and rendering capabilities. Content can be viewed on a number of platforms ranging from standard web browsers on desktop computers and VR headsets, on phones / tablets with passthrough AR (FireFox WebXR Viewer, Chrome) and wearable AR headsets (Hololens Edge Browser, Magic Leap Lumin Browser).

See the following sections for details on requirements, setting up scenes for mixed reality experiences and anchoring them.
