# Animations and GLTF Morphs in ARENA-py

Dispatching and running animations and GLTF 3D Morphs.

##  Animations

### Dispatching Animations
You can add animations to objects that will run when `scene.run_animations(...)` is called:
```python
obj = Box()
obj.dispatch_animation(
        Animation(
            property="rotation",
            start=(0,0,0),
            end=(0,180,0),
            easing="linear",
            dur=1000
        )
    )
scene.run_animations(obj) # this will cause the animation to be run
```
You can also dispatch multiple `Animation`s:
```python
obj = Box()
obj.dispatch_animation(
        [
            Animation(
                property="rotation",
                start=(0,0,0),
                end=(0,180,0),
                easing="linear",
                dur=1000
            ),
            Animation(
                property="position",
                start=(0,0,-5),
                end=(0,0,-10),
                easing="linear",
                dur=1000
            )
        ]
    )
scene.run_animations(obj) # this will cause all the dispatched animations to be run.

```

Note that the tweening of these properties occur browser-clientside. For the position property example above, at the point halfway through the animation duration, the Position property will *not* be updated to `(0, 0, -7.5)` internally. Instead, it will update to its end position at the end of the animation duration. This final position update may also change if in the middle of the duration, the position property is separately updated or if a second animation is dispatched that also changes position.

### Animation vs AnimationMixer
`AnimationMixer`s are special animations specific to a 3D model. These can be run the same way as regular `Animation`s.
See the [Animation component](https://github.com/n5ro/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders#animation).
```python
xr_logo.dispatch_animation(
    AnimationMixer(clip="*", loop="repeat")
)
scene.run_animations(xr_logo) # this will cause the 3D model to play its animations
```

### Permanent Animations
Sometimes you want `Animation`s to be associated with the object. You can do this by adding the `Animation` as an `Attribute` to the `Object`:
```python
# this makes it such that xr_logo will ALWAYS play the animation when someone joins
# your ARENA scene, since the animation is now associated with that object:
xr_logo.update_attributes(
    animation_mixer=AnimationMixer(
            clip="*", loop="repeat"
        )
)
```

## GLTF Morphs

### Morph and update_morph
GLTF morphs can be created with the `Morph` class, and can be added to an object with the `update_morph` method:
```python
# create list of Morphs
open_eye_morph = [Morph(morphtarget="eyeTop",value=0.0), Morph(morphtarget="eyeBottom",value=0.0)]

xr_logo.update_morph(open_eye_morph) # accepts Morphs and lists of Morph
```
