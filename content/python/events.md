# Events in ARENA-py

Events are ways to interact with user input in the ARENA.

See [messaging](https://scene.conix.io/content/messaging/examples.html).

## Event handlers
To handle events in ARENA-py, you must set a function to the `evt_handler` parameter.
When you attach an `evt_handler` to an Object, you will receive `Event` objects in your handler.
Below is how you access attributes of the Event object.

```python
def click_handler(evt): # evt = Event(...)
    print(evt)

    ## Get Event type
    evt.type # == "mousedown", "mouseup", "mouseenter", "mouseleave", etc

    ## Get Event data
    evt.data.clickPos
    evt.data.position
    evt.data.source
    # etc etc

box = Box(..., evt_handler=click_handler) # note the use of "evt_handler=click_handler"
```

## Generating events with ARENA-py
### Click Events
There are several types of click events that you can generate ("mousedown", "mouseup", "mouseenter", "mouseleave", "triggerdown", "triggerup"):
```python
scene.generate_click_event(obj, type, ...)

# add a click listener to an object to be able to click it
obj.update_attributes(clickable=True)
# generate a "fake" click event from ARENA-py
scene.generate_click_event(
    obj,
    type="mouseup"
)
# ARENA-py will "click" obj with mouseup. In JSON, "source" will be defined as "arena_lib_[some random id here]".
```

### Camera Manipulation Events
You can also move a user's camera and/or make it look at a specific location or object:
```python
scene.manipulate_camera(obj, type, ...)

# move camera:
scene.manipulate_camera(
    camera,
    position=(rando(),1.6,rando()),
    rotation=(0,0,0,1)
)

# make camera look at something/some position:
scene.look_at(
    camera,
    target=box # can also do a position: (0,0,0)
)
```

### Generic Events
If there is an event that does not exist yet, you can use this to have more freedom in the event type:
```python
# define custom event
evt = Event(type="my_custom_event", position=(3,4,5), target=sphere)
# generate custom event with ARENA-py client
scene.generate_custom_event(evt, action="clientEvent")
```

# Appendix
```python
Event(object_id, action, type, ...)
```

## ARENA Event JSON example
```json
{
    "object_id": "my_box",
    "action": "clientEvent",
    "type": "mousedown",
    "data": {
        "clickPos": {
            "x": -1.525,
            "y": 1.6,
            "z": 12.171
        },
        "position": {
            "x": 0.318,
            "y": 4.02,
            "z": -1
        },
        "source": "[source goes here here]"
    },
    "timestamp": "[time goes here]"
}
```
