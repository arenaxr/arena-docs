# Arena Library Message Callbacks

There are three types of message callback functions you can specify:

## on_msg_callback
This is called whenever there is a new message sent to the client. Use this whenever you want to sniff out all incoming messages.

### Usage:
```python
def on_msg_callback(msg):
    # msg will be a python dictionary not an ARENA-py object (for now)
    # do stuff with msg here
    # msg["object_id"], msg["data"], etc

arena.on_msg_callback = on_msg_callback
```

## new_obj_callback
This is called whenever there is a new object that has been created in the scene, one that the user does not have a reference to. Use this to make references to any new objects that may appear during a programs lifetime. Also a good way to find camera ID's.

### Usage:
```python
def new_obj_callback(msg):
    # msg will be a python dictionary not an ARENA-py object (for now)
    # do stuff with msg here
    # msg["object_id"], msg["data"], etc

arena.new_obj_callback = new_obj_callback
```

## delete_obj_callback
This is called whenever there is an object has been deleted in the scene. ARENA-py will look for all "action" = "delete" messages and call this callback. Use this to delete references and to be notified when an object is removed by another user or program.

### Usage:
```python
def delete_obj_callback(msg):
    # msg will be a python dictionary not an ARENA-py object (for now)
    # do stuff with msg here
    # msg["object_id"], etc
    #
    # usually, msg will be:
    # {
    #   "object_id": "[deleted object id here]",
    #   "action": "delete"
    # }

arena.delete_obj_callback = delete_obj_callback
```

## Adding callbacks when you instantiate the class
You can also add callbacks like so:
```python
from arena import *

def on_msg_callback(msg):
    pass

def new_obj_callback(msg):
    pass

def delete_obj_callback(msg):
    pass

arena = Arena(..., on_msg_callback=on_msg_callback, new_obj_callback=new_obj_callback, delete_obj_callback=delete_obj_callback)
```
