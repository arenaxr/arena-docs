# Temporary Objects: TTL

It's desirable to have objects that don't last forever and pile up. For that there is the 'ttl' parameter that gives objects a lifetime, in seconds. This is an example usage for a sphere that disappears after 5 seconds.

```python
from arena import *

scene = Scene(host="arenaxr.org", scene="example")


@scene.run_once
def make_timed_sphere():
    my_ball = Sphere(
        object_id="Ball2",
        position=(-1, 1, -1),
        ttl=5,
    )
    scene.add_object(my_ball)


scene.run_tasks()
```
