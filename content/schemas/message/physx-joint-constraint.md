`physx-joint-constraint`
========================


Adds a constraint to a physx-joint. Supported joints are D6, Revolute and Prismatic. Can only be used on an entity with the physx-joint component. Requires `scene-options: physics`.

This is the schema for PhysX Joint Constraint, the properties of object `physx-joint-constraint`.

PhysX Joint Constraint Attributes
----------------------------------

|Attribute|Type|Default|Description|Required|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**lockedAxes**|array|```[]```|[D6] Which axes are explicitly locked by this constraint and can't be moved at all. Should be some combination of x, y, z, twist, swing.|No|
|**constrainedAxes**|array|```[]```|[D6] Which axes are constrained by this constraint. These axes can be moved within the set limits. Should be some combination of x, y, z, twist, swing.|No|
|**freeAxes**|array|```[]```|[D6] Which axes are explicitly freed by this constraint. These axes will not obey any limits set here. Should be some combination of x, y, z, twist, swing.|No|
|**linearLimit**|[vector2](vector2)||[D6, Prismatic] Limit on linear movement. Only affects x, y, and z axes. First component is the minimum allowed position.|No|
|**angularLimit**|[vector2](vector2)||[Revolute] Limit on angular movement in degrees. First component is the minimum allowed angle, second is the maximum.|No|
|**limitCone**|[vector2](vector2)||[D6] Two angles in degrees specifying a cone in which the joint is allowed to swing, like a pendulum.|No|
|**twistLimit**|[vector2](vector2)||[D6] Minimum and maximum angles in degrees that the joint is allowed to twist.|No|
|**damping**|number|```0```|[All] Spring damping for soft constraints.|No|
|**restitution**|number|```0```|[All] Spring restitution for soft constraints.|No|
|**stiffness**|number|```0```|[All] If greater than 0, will make this joint a soft constraint, and use a spring force model.|No|
