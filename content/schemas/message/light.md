Light
=====


A light.

More properties at <a href='https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/light.html'>A-Frame Light</a>.

All wire objects have a set of basic attributes ```{object_id, action, type, persist, data}```. The ```data``` attribute defines the object-specific attributes

Light Attributes
-----------------

|Attribute|Type|Default|Description|Required|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**object_id**|string||A uuid or otherwise unique identifier for this object.|Yes|
|**persist**|boolean|```True```|Persist this object in the database.|Yes|
|**type**|string; Must be: ```object```|```'object'```|AFrame 3D Object|Yes|

|**ttl**|number||When applied to an entity, the entity will remove itself from DOM after the specified number of seconds. Update is allowed, which will reset the timer to start from that moment.|No|

|**shadowMapHeight**|number|```512```|Shadow map's vertical resolution. Larger shadow maps display more crisp shadows, at the cost of performance.|No|

|**parent**|string||Parent's object_id. Child objects inherit attributes of their parent, for example scale and translation.|No|
|**position**|[position](position)||3D object position.|Yes|
|**rotation**|[rotation](rotation)||3D object rotation in quaternion representation; Right-handed coordinate system. Euler degrees are deprecated in wire message format.|Yes|
|**scale**|[scale](scale)||3D object scale.|No|
