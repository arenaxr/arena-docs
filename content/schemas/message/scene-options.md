ARENA Scene Options.

This is the schema for Scene Options, the properties of object `scene-options`.

Scene Options Attributes
-------------------------

|Attribute|Type|Default|Description|Required|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**originMarker**|boolean|```True```|Include a default 15cm x 15cm AprilTag marker 0 at the origin of the scene.|Yes|
|**clickableOnlyEvents**|boolean|```True```|True = publish only mouse events for objects with click-listeners; False = all objects publish mouse events.|No|
|**distanceModel**|string; One of: ```['exponential', 'inverse', 'linear']```|```'inverse'```|Algorithm to use to reduce the volume of the audio source as it moves away from the listener.|No|
|**sceneHeadModels**|array|```[]```|Define the default head model(s) for the scene in a list. Users may still choose from the ARENA default list of head models as well.|No|
|**jitsiHost**|string|```'jitsi0.andrew.cmu.edu:8443'```|Jitsi host used for this scene.|No|
|**maxAVDist**|number|```20```|Maximum distance between cameras/users until audio and video are cut off. For saving bandwidth on scenes with large amounts of user activity at once.|Yes|
|**navMesh**|string|```''```|Navigation Mesh URL.|No|
|**networkedLocationSolver**|boolean|```False```|ARMarker location solver parameter. By default (networkedLocationSolver=false) clients solve camera location locally when a static marker is detected. When true, publishes marker detections (to realm/g/a/camera-name) and defers all tag solving of client camera to a solver sitting on pubsub.|No|
|**privateScene**|boolean|```False```|False = scene will be visible; True = scene will not show in listings.|Yes|
|**refDistance**|number|```1```|Distance at which the volume reduction starts taking effect.|No|
|**rolloffFactor**|number|```1```|How quickly the volume is reduced as the source moves away from the listener.|No|
|**screenshare**|string|```'screenshare'```|Name of the 3D object used when sharing desktop.|No|
|**videoFrustumCulling**|boolean|```True```|If false, will disable video frustum culling (video frustum culling stops video from users outside of view).|No|
|**videoDistanceConstraints**|boolean|```True```|If false, will disable video distance constraints (video resolution decreases with distance from users in view).|No|
|**videoDefaultResolutionConstraint**|number|```180```|Sets the default max resolution for all users. Ignored when videoDistanceConstraints = true.|No|
|**volume**|number|```1```|Volume for users in a scene.|No|
|**physics**|object||Clientside PhysX-based physics system. Required for all physx-* components|Yes|
|**ar-hit-test**|object||A-Frame AR Hit Test Settings.

More properties at <a href='https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/ar-hit-test.html'>AR Hit Test</a> component.|No|
|**openvps**|object||Set an OpenVPS server to localize by camera image on mobile devices|No|
