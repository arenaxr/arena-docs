PhysX Material
==============


Controls physics properties for individual shapes or rigid bodies. Can be set on an entity with physx-body or on shapes contained within it. Requires `scene-options: physics`.

PhysX Material Attributes
--------------------------

|Attribute|Type|Default|Description|Required|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**staticFriction**|number|```0.2```|Static friction applied when objects are not moving relative to each other.|No|
|**dynamicFriction**|number|```0.2```|Dynamic friction applied when objects are moving relative to each other.|No|
|**restitution**|number|```0.2```|Restitution, or 'bounciness' of the material.|No|
|**density**|number||Density for the shape. If specified for all shapes in a rigid body, mass properties will be automatically calculated based on densities.|No|
|**collisionLayers**|array|```[1]```|Which collision layers this shape is present on.|No|
|**collidesWithLayers**|array|```[1, 2, 3, 4]```|Array containing all layers that this shape should collide with.|No|
|**collisionGroup**|number|```0```|If greater than 0, this shape will not collide with any other shape with the same collisionGroup value.|No|
|**contactOffset**|string||If >= 0, sets the PhysX contact offset, indicating how far away from the shape simulation contact events should begin.|No|
|**restOffset**|string||If >= 0, sets the PhysX rest offset.|No|
