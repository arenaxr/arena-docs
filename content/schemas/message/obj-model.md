OBJ Model
=========


Loads a 3D model and material using a Wavefront (.OBJ) file and a .MTL file.

See guidance to store paths under <a href='https://docs.arenaxr.org/content/interface/filestore.html'>ARENA File Store, CDN, or DropBox</a>.

All wire objects have a set of basic attributes ```{object_id, action, type, persist, data}```. The ```data``` attribute defines the object-specific attributes

OBJ Model Attributes
---------------------

|Attribute|Type|Default|Description|Required|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**object_id**|string||A uuid or otherwise unique identifier for this object.|Yes|
|**persist**|boolean|```True```|Persist this object in the database.|Yes|
