`physx-joint`
=============


Creates a PhysX joint between an ancestor rigid body and a target rigid body. Position and rotation of the entity will be used to create the corresponding joint. Requires `scene-options: physics`.

This is the schema for PhysX Joint, the properties of object `physx-joint`.

PhysX Joint Attributes
-----------------------

|Attribute|Type|Default|Description|Required|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**type**|string; One of: ```['Spherical', 'Fixed', 'Revolute', 'Prismatic', 'D6']```|```'Spherical'```|Rigid body joint type to use. Each type has different movement constraints.|No|
|**target**|string||Target object selector. Must be an entity having the physx-body component. If not specified, joins to the initial position in the world.|No|
|**breakForce**|[vector2](vector2)|```{'x': -1, 'y': -1}```|Force needed to break the constraint. First component is linear force, second is angular force in degrees. Set both components >= 0 to enable.|No|
|**removeElOnBreak**|boolean|```False```|If true, removes the entity containing this component when the joint is broken.|No|
|**collideWithTarget**|boolean|```False```|If false, collision will be disabled between the rigid body containing the joint and the target rigid body.|No|
|**softFixed**|boolean|```False```|When used with a D6 type, sets up a 'soft' fixed joint. E.g., for grabbing things.|No|
|**projectionTolerance**|[vector2](vector2)|```{'x': -1, 'y': -1}```|Kinematic projection, which forces joint back into alignment when the solver fails. First component is linear tolerance in meters, second is angular tolerance in degrees.|No|
