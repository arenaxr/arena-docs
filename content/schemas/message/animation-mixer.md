`animation-mixer`
=================


A list of available animations can usually be found by inspecting the model file or its documentation. All animations will play by default. To play only a specific set of animations, use wildcards: animation-mixer='clip: run_*'. Requires `object_type: gltf-model`.

More properties at <a href='https://github.com/n5ro/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/loaders#animation'>A-Frame Extras Animation</a>.

This is the schema for Animation Mixer, the properties of object `animation-mixer`.
