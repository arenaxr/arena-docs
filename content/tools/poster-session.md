Because poster sessions in ARENA are a common use case, we created a script to [programmatically create a poster session scene](https://github.com/conix-center/ARENA-py/tree/master/tools/poster-session).

The script creates poster walls using data from a google spreadsheet. For each line in the table (indicated by a range in the config file), it creates a poster wall. See the template [google spreadsheet template with instructions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwVURk0BHHtncpeokjm0FZO_sffS7vjmVxt0ewxKaBU/edit?usp=sharing).

The script operates on a scene at the time, but you can have data in the template spreadsheet for several scenes, and run the script once for each scene (indicated in the config file or passed through argument).

## Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
make run
```

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed. The Makefile creates a [virtual environment that deals with installing all dependencies](https://github.com/sio/Makefile.venv), including the **arena-py library** (from pyPI; it does not use the development version in this repo).

Before running, you also need to create a config file (default `config.yaml`). The repository includes a `config_example.yaml` that you can rename to `config.yaml` and adapt.

### Google Apps Script API
The script uses the google apps script API to get the spreadsheet data. Make sure to follow these google python library pre-requisites:						
1. A Google Cloud Platform project with *Google Sheets API* and *Google Drive API* enabled. See how to [create a project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project)
2. Authorization credentials for a desktop application (pasted into 'credentials.json'). See how to [create credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials).

More details [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/quickstart/python?hl=en).

## Arguments

The script accepts the following optional arguments:
```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIGFILE, --conf CONFIGFILE
                        The configuration file. Default is ./config.yaml
  -s SCENENAME          Scenename of the poster session (e.g. theme1, theme2)
```

To pass arguments to the script, add the ARGS variable when invoking Make, e.g.:

```bash
make ARGS='-h'
make ARGS='--conf=myconfigfile.yaml'
```

## Environment Variables

Define environment variables to pass to the script in the Makefile. You can add new targets for these, e.g.:
```
cmu-test: venv
  (NAMESPACE=cmu SCENE=test $(VENV)/python pplacement.py $(ARGS))
```

## Config file

Most of the time, you will want to invoke the script with no arguments:

```bash
make run
```

And define options in the **config file** (`./config.yaml` by default).

> *Note*: the repository includes a `config_example.yaml` that you can rename to `config.yaml` and adapt.

The config file looks like this:

```yaml
# persist objects (True/False)
# True: objects will be saved and appear in the scene after a reload
# False:objects will disappear after a reload (and only appear to clients already viewing the scene when they are created)
persist: False

  layout: ROWCOL
  layout_args:
    row_dist: 20
    col_dist: 20
    row_off: 20
    col_off: -50
```
**Note**: The scenename command line argument overrides the config file scenename.

## Poster Wall Layouts for Each Scene

You can add a section in the config file to define how the posters are arranged in each scene. To do this, add a section (to `config.yaml`) with the scene name and define the layout parameters. For example, the section below will define a line arrangement for the poster walls of scene `test`:
```yaml
test:
  layout: LINE
  layout_args:
    length: 200 # length of the line (will try to layout the walls evenly spaced)
    rotation: 90 # rotation (degrees) of the walls
    alternating_rot: True # alternating rotation to make the walls face each other in pairs
```

The layouts supported and their options are shown below.

#### ROWCOL: arrange walls in rows and columns
##### Parameters:

- row_dist=30: distance between rows
- col_dist=30: distance between cols

- row_dir=-1: direction of rows (1 or -1)
- col_axis='x': which axis is used as the col axis
- row_axis='z': which axis is used as the row axis
