# Sharing a Link to a Meeting Space
You can use any of our pre-built ARENA scenes for group meetings and unique social experience if you like. We recommend cloning an existing scene so you will be able to control access to the scene for meetings.

1. Select a Public Scene
2. Duplicate Scene into your own namespace

3. Set the scene name for your  meeting
