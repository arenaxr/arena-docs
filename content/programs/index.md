# ARENA Programs 

It is possible to host programs in ARENA that are added to a scene and are automatically started to programmatically control your scenes.

The recommended way to create an ARENA program is using the [ARENA Python Library](/content/python). Once you have the python code developed, you can host it in ARENA. This is a quick summary of what is process to add a program:
1. Go to the [file store](https://arenaxr.org/files) and add the program files.
2. Edit/create the scene that will load your program using the [scene builder](content/overview/build.html).
3. See the [Dashboard](https://arenaxr.org/programs/) to see the runtimes and modules running.
