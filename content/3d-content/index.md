# Generating 3D Content Overview

We use a number of tools and techniques for 3d-models in the ARENA. Foremost we recommend using the [GLTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) model format whenever possible, it was designed to generate uniform rendering across multiple platforms, especially the web where the ARENA lives.

The section outlines methods for converting [GLTF Files](/content/3d-content/gltf-files).
You can export a Blender scene with our [Blender Add-on](/content/3d-content/blender-addon).
[Downscaling Models](/content/3d-content/downscaling) for performance, [Export Unity](/content/3d-content/unity) models,
and [Convert SketchUp ](/content/3d-content/dimension).

It is useful to bring real-world assets into your ARENA scene s through scanning.
We have a list of LIDAR, NERF, and Photogrammetry [scan tools listed](/content/3d-content/scan-tools).

You may want from animate your 3d models.
To that end we have some ideas to [Animate Faces](/content/3d-content/animated-faces) or [Animate Models](/content/3d-content/blender-animation)

Don't forget to add a [Navigation Mesh](/content/3d-content/mesh-nav).
