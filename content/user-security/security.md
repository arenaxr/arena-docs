# ARENA Security

## Anonymous or Authenticated

## Google Auth, for the time being

## User database

## User Roles

## Authentication

## Authorization

## Authority Flow MQTT Messages

The root of trust for MQTT messages derives from the ACL permissions stored in the user database. The user database is consulted to generate the MQTT token (jwt1), then each client can use the jwt to connect to the MQTT broker. The scene persistence database generates its own jwt2 to subscribe to published messages.

This means that ACL scenes can only be stored in the user database, since the scene persistence database depends on the token (jwt1) generated by the user database for published messages to succeed.

## User IDs

ARENA visitors are uniquely identified by their camera name, which is also their user name. As all 3D objects in the ARENA are identified by names, camera IDs have 3 underscore separated components, e.g: `camera_1234_er1k`. The last part is what appears above your head (representation in the 3D view), the middle part is a unique ID. If you want to override the random unique ID, you can specify on the URL parameter e.g. `&fixedCamera=er1k` which will ignore the `&name=` and so `er1k` will appear above your head and the camera ID will be `camera_er1k_er1k`.
