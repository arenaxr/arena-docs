## ACL Default New Users

Approaches: We want all users to have the ability to view and move in scenes easily.
Default Viewer Closed (current):

- User gets read access to all.
- User gets write access to personal objects (camera, controllers, avatar) only.
- User must apply for writing other scene objects through the ACL website, awaiting scene owners permission.
